### Student

I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering student going to UCSD!
As a third year I am beginning to take more ECE upper division electives which I hope will help me develop my knowledge as a student. 
As of right now I am in a Deep Learning class which I hope to use to develop and apply during my life as a programmer.

### Athlete

As an athlete I have experience with 
***Basketball***

A quote that I learned as an athlete that can apply to all parts of my life has been: 

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. 

I have found this applicable even as a promgrammer because not taking that first step in the project will mean the won't get started.


### Programmer

After coding for 4 years I have gainned experience with multiple languages such as:
```
C
C++
Java
```
