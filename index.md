### Student

I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering student going to UCSD!
As a third year I am beginning to take more ECE upper division electives which I hope will help me develop my knowledge as a student. 
As of right now I am in a Deep Learning class which I hope to use to develop and apply during my life as a programmer.

### Athlete

As an athlete I have experience with 
***Basketball***

***Track and Field***

A quote that I learned as an athlete that can apply to all parts of my life has been: 

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. 

I have found this applicable even as a promgrammer because not taking that first step in the project will mean the won't get started.


### Programmer

After coding for 4 years I have gainned experience with multiple languages such as:
```
C
C++
Java
```

I look forward to using the knowledge I gain from taking CSE and ECE classes to further myself in my career. 
One of the ambitions or dream goals would be to work for a gaming company like [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).

I have even developed a few ideas about using my programming skills for some of my hobbies such as gaming!

1. Using Deep Learning to create a program that will predict round wins for games
2. Building a piece of software that will analyze highlights from professional matches and allow you to try the highlight out yourself
3. Creating a software that will help people practice outside of a match!

I want to gain enough experience so that I can complete some of these projects on my own.

Some of the setbacks I expect to encounter are:

- My inexperience working with game code
- Finding the time to work on side projects
- Finding people that would be able to help with the developments of these projects
